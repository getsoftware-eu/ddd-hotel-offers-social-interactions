	<b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b>
				<br/><br/>


	When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under
	13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
	control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection
	agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of

				<br/><br/>
	We do not specifically market to children under 13.
				<br/><br/>


	<b>Fair Information Practices</b>

				<br/><br/>

	The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
	in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
	significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
	globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
	should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
	that protect personal information.
				<br/><br/>
	<b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
	following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</b>
				<br/><br/>
	We will notify the users via email
				<br/><br/>
				<ul>
					 <li>Within 1 business day</li></ul>
				<br/><br/>
	We will notify the users via in site notification
				<br/><br/>
				<ul>
					 <li> Within 1 business day</li></ul>
				<br/><br/>

	We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that
	individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data
	collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
	requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
	users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government
	agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

				<br/><br/>

	<b>CAN SPAM Act</b>


				<br/><br/>
	The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,

	penalties for violations.
				<br/><br/>
	<b>We collect your email address in order to:</b>

				<br/><br/>
	<b>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</b>
				<br/><br/>
